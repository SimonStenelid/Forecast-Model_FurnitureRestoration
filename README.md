## Project Overview
- This project is for my furniture restoration business, if I were to start it again and a plan on how the business could run for the first years.  
- There by I created a **financial forecast model**, to forecast the **profit / loss** over the next coming years.  
- I created **2 scenarios**, one were I would still work as a **sole proprietor (full-time)**, and the other scenario I would start a **limited company (aktiebolag)** and hire a part time worker.

## Context
So... between 2023 and 2024, I ran a small furniture restoration business. I started it after seeing someone on Instagram buying old furniture, restoring it, and then selling it for a profit.  
  
  It went really well, and the profit margins were good, allowing me to make a small extra income while doing it part-time.

- I later decided to close the business to focus on my studies. However, I wondered whether the business would succeed if I pursued it full-time.
- **🔁 So, I created this project to explore whether it would really be worth trying again.**

## Data Source
- The data was gathered from the financial statement of my old business (for year 2023).
- The scenarios are hypothetical
- The forecast model was built by me (thanks for great tutorials [@KenjiExplains](https://www.youtube.com/@KenjiExplains))

## Process
1. Creating the two scenarios.
 
> 1️⃣ **I will continue to be a sole proprietor but full-time.**  
> 2️⃣ **I will start a limited company (AB) and hire a part-time worker after one year.**

2. Gather financial data from my old business. I sold a total of 15 pieces during 2023, with an average order value of 6,000 SEK.
3. Estimate "order growth rate" for the coming years 2024-2027 (2024 have already passed, but well well..)
4. That would give me the forecasted revenue for the next years, in relation to how many furniture pieces I could produce per year.
5. I estimate that my COGS (per order) would stay the same, about 800 SEK per piece.
6. Operating expenses are adjusted to how many furniture pieces I forecasted, whereby I would need a larger warehouse (not my parents basement anymore..). Likewise payroll for part-time worker, marketing, and tools for us.
7. Taxes vairy depending on company form.
8. Financial Breakdown  

> 📌 **Thus, the profit calculation follows these steps:**  
>  
> ✅ **Revenue - COGS** = *Gross Profit*  
> ✅ **Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses** = *Operating Profit*  
> ✅ **Operating Profit - Tax** = *Net Profit / Loss*

## Conclusions
- Both scenarios would be profitable
- Profit margin *%* would be similar for both
> Sole proprietor : **341 228 SEK profit after 5 years**    
> Limited company (AB) :  **1 356 867 SEK profit after 5 years**

_-- Thus, yeah! I might some day in the future start the business again, if I ever would get bored with the spreadsheets. 📉_
